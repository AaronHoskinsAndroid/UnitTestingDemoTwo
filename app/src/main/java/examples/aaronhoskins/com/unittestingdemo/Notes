Unit Testing, UI Testing, Continuous Integration

    - Unit Testing
        - The logic and returns of methods within a class
        - No device is needed for unit testing
        - Some major Lib. we use for unit testing
            - Junit
                - Allows for assertion test
                    ex: equals, true, false assertion
                - Test if the return matches the assertions made
            - Mockito
                - Generally for creating mock object and returns
                - VERY helpful when classes have dependencies
            - Power Mock
                - Much like Mockito but has more functionality
                    - Testing static values and returns
        - Basic Annotations needed
            - @RunWith(<runner>)
                - Decides which framework will perform the test
            - @Before
                - Runs the block of code annotated with this EVERY
                    single test method/function
            - @BeforeClass
                - Runs once for each class but not each method/fun
            - @Test
                - Designates the method/function is a test of the
                    logic within the class/object being tested
    Test Driven Development
        - Development methodology where unit test are written before actual
            code development.

Continuous Integration (Continuous Development)
    - Software development principle where the developers are
        constantly performing unit test and test builds of the
        software to insure code quality and functionality
    - CI tools
        - Jenkins - Most Popular
        - Travis - free
        - Bamboo
        - Firebase Testlabs
        - CircleCI
        - ...
    - What most tools will do
        - Run unit test
        - Compile and build program and resources
        - Generate a report showing results and if test passed/failed
    - What they require
        - Repository access
        - Script (custom to the CI tool) to define how and what to build
            and test
        - Subscription to the service
